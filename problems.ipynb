    "    To increase the strength of passwords, prepending a salt can be used. Prepending is when information is added to the beginning of a password or a string to increase the security ([see reference](https://www.swindx.com/glossary/prepending/)). Salting is the act of adding a series of random characters to a password before going through the hashing function ([see reference](https://www.okta.com/blog/identity-security/what-are-salted-passwords-and-password-hashing/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When a user is creating a password for the first time a random salt is generated and added to the beginning of the users password to make it more secure. The combination of the salt and original password is then hashed and stored.\n",
    "        <!-- </br> -->\n",
    "        - The salt and the password value are stored seperately in a database but used together for password validation when they need to be hashed again.\n",
    "    </br>\n",

    "    **Example of prepending the Salt** </br>\n",

    "    - Prepending a unique salt to the common password *(example: `cheese`)* turns it into a distinct credential that is extremely unlikely to appear in a common-password lists.
