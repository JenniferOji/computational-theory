Prepending is when information is added to the beginning of a password or a string to increase the security ([see reference](https://www.swindx.com/glossary/prepending/)). Salting is the act of adding a series of random characters to a password before going through the hashing function ([see reference](https://www.okta.com/blog/identity-security/what-are-salted-passwords-and-password-hashing/)).\n",
